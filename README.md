## Overview

The interactive comment section allow user to post, edit, delete, reply, up-vote and down-vote a comment .This project uses HTML , CSS and JavaScript to create the layout, style and functionality of the comments sections. It also uses a LocalStorage web API to store and retrieve data.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Learn how to use grid-row and grid-column for responsiveness.
and how to fetch data dynamically without complicating the `async function` call

```css
.headings {
  grid-row: 1/2;
  grid-column: 1/3;
}

.comment {
  grid-column: 1/3;
  grid-row: 2/3;
}
```

```js
const fetchData = async function () {
  try {
    let data;
    if (localStorage.getItem("data")) {
      data = getFromStorage();
    } else {
      const response = await fetch("../data.json");
      data = await response.json();
      setToStorage(data);
    }

    loadPage(data);
  } catch (err) {
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-console
    console.error(err);
  }
};
```

### Useful resources

- [Learn how to use Grid lines](https://youtu.be/J5GWyiWU2H8?si=hbp09X2c7h2sLrHS) - This helped me understand better how grid works and to use it for layout structure for responsiveness.

To run StyleLint by itself, you may run the lint task:

```bash
npm run lint:check
```

Or to automatically fix issues found (where possible):

```bash
npm run lint
```

You can also check against Prettier:

```bash
npm run format:check
```

and to have it actually fix (to the best of its ability) any format issues, run:

```bash
npm run format
```
